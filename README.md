This is a script that asks for bus location data from multiple sources at once and then determines which stops the buses are closest to.  In NJ when you text the code on the bus stop it will tell you there are no buses at all if it's more than a half hour away, so you'll be freezing in the snow trying to text every stop along the route trying to determine if you have time to run away from the stop to get food.  10 minutes of work now occurs in mere seconds.  If I were to do it all over again I would have the user input the bus number and the app would scrape the bus id#s from the nj transit site.  for now, I have the stop IDs hardcoded into arrays on pages I made for only 3 buses.  I could make it self replicate, but I abandoned the project when I got a new car.  When winter was almost already over.
